## Chapter 1. Clean code

1. LeBlancâ€™s law: Later equals never.
2. Explain the time and effort estimation by discussing potential risks of ignoring them.
3. Bad code tempts the mess to grow. Don't create that tempt.
4. Metaphor of broken windows:" A building with broken windows looks like nobody cares about
   it. So other people stop caring. They allow more windows to become broken. Eventually
   they actively break them.".
5. Writing good code means paying attention to details: "not deep enough" error handling,
memory leaks, race conditions, inconsistent naming etc.
6. Clean code is focused. Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely
   undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.
7. Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author.
8. The unit of code should do what is expected from it.
9. "The Boy Scout Rule" for programmers: Leave the code cleaner than you found it.
