HTTP Streaming is a push-style data transfer technique that 
allows a web server to continuously send data to a client 
over a single HTTP connection that remains open indefinitely. 
Technically, this goes against HTTP convention, but HTTP Streaming 
is an efficient method to transfer all kinds of dynamic or 
otherwise streamable data between the server and client 
without reinventing HTTP.
